\subsection{Operating Point Analysis}

Table~\ref{tab:op} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit
under analysis. Compared to the theoretical analysis results, we obtained the same results, as should be expected.

    and expressed in Ampere; other variables are of type {\it voltage} and expressed in
    Volt.}
